# Reddit Comment Bot 🤖

A Reddit bot that scans posts in popular subreddits, generates replies using a language model API (Groq), and comments automatically on posts with extreme upvote ratios.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Picks a random subreddit from a predefined list.
2. Looks for recent posts with **very high** or **very low** upvote ratios.
3. Uses a **language model API** (Groq or OpenAI-compatible) to generate a reply.
4. Posts that reply as a Reddit comment.
5. Waits a random amount of time before repeating.
